### Disclaimer
Due to the continuing LooCipher infection campaign, we proceeded to release the decryptor in the shortest possible time in order to help the victims infected in the previous phase. So, the tool is a Beta release and it is still composed by an unsigned executable. We will provide to release some updates as soon as possible.
